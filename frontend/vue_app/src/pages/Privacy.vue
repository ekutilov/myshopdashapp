        It downloads your shopping statements and eReceipts,

        paid, the number of the loyalty card presented, mode of payment,
        four last digits of the number of the bank card used as payment (if any),

        from the Woolworths company servers and saves it in your browser's storage. 
        It doesn't send it over to the internet.</p>
      <p>You have an option to download this data onto your computer as a json-formatted file
        from the browser. In this case, <b>your data is not transferred
        anywhere</b> at all.</p>
